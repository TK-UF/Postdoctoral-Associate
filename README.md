The McIntosh Research Laboratory at the University of Florida’s Child Health Research Institute, seeks a highly motivated Postdoctoral Research Associate to join a team exploring the roles of novel infectious agents in diseases of unknown etiology or emerging epidemiology. 

Research emphasis is on detection and characterization of potential pathogens and investigating host microbial interactions to reveal underlying mechanisms of disease as well as targets for diagnosis or intervention.

Specialized expertise is sought in three or more of the following: Molecular Biology, LINUX/UNIX and Python scripting, MySQL, metagenomics, transcriptomics, epigenetics, statistics, and/or SNP analysis of human genomes in the context of cancer. 

Duties include:
•	Designing and performing experiments using a variety of techniques including: conventional and realtime PCR/RT-PCR, immunoprecipitation, chromatin immunoprecipitation, Western blotting, FACS, Sanger sequencing, next-generation sequencing, and various Capture-Seq approaches, CRISPR-Cas editing of genomes, virus isolation of suspect human, animal and insect pathogens, transfection and transduction of cells, transformation of cells to establish new cell lines, reverse genetics of viruses, cloning and protein purification.
•	Maintaining proper lab records.
•	Providing guidance and training for undergraduate and graduate student researchers.
•	Preparation of manuscripts. May also assist in grant writing.
•	Laboratory maintenance, including equipment maintenance, and ordering of supplies as needed.
•	Other duties as assigned, which may include attending scientific conferences and meetings.
